      <h1>The Philosophy</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! I'm a builder at heart, driven by a fascination with how technology can solve complex challenges. My journey is rooted in software development and machine learning, particularly in the realm of computer vision. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to reality, whether it's a complex project combining ResNet50 and Vision Transformers, or a practical tool like an AI nutrition tracker.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for me, the 'how' is just as important as the 'what'. My passion extends beyond the code to understanding the bigger picture. I actively study business strategy and market analysis in the AI space and enjoy dissecting industrial problems to find optimal solutions. This analytical mindset is balanced by a deep interest in spirituality and the nature of reality, which gives me a unique perspective on creative problem-solving.

      <p>
        From building custom dashboards to track my DSA and gym progress to developing MLOps pipelines for fun classifiers, I am constantly learning and creating. I am currently looking for a remote software developer opportunity to apply my skills and grow within a team. Thank you for visiting.</p>
